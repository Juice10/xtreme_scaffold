XtremeScaffold
==============

This is a replacement for the standard scaffold. It creates a _form partial instead of the standar default, it creates list_for lists and supports nested routes! So if you have /posts/comments/ you simply specify --belongs_to post when you scaffold comment. You will get paths like new_post_comment(@post)! I have fixed all those disturbing things in the standard scaffold as I like them, hope you feel like me :) 

Example
=======

script/generate xtreme_scaffold comment --belongs_to post post_id:integer text:text
